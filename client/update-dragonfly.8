.Nd provides binary update functionality for
.Dx
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ghinrv

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm

.Nm
supports incremental updates and
provides a backup function so that accidently installed updates can be
reinstalled.
.Pp
.Nm
checks if the file to be updated exists an checks if the file matches the
provided checksum.  If that is true the file will be patched and stored for
later install.  If the checksum differs (the user compiled the world with
custom compiler flags) the whole file is fetched from the server.  The user
can chose if he wants to overwrite custom files (OVERWRITE option in the
.Nm.conf
config file).
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Use this config file
.It Fl g
Get available updates
.It Fl h
Print usage
.It Fl i
Install previous fetched updates

install steps taken
.It Fl r
Reinstall previously backed up files
.It Fl v
Be more verbose
.El
